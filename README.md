API Implemented: Yelp API
API URL: https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3

Functionality: For my project I am using the Yelp API to search buisnesses based on different options for caterogies
(which the user selects) and a city (which the user inputs). I then call the API and get 32 buisness. I display the buissines
in a nice format using a table.

Javascript: I implemented different forms fo java script for this project. I used JQuery to make sure you only display
the results table when the user presses sumbit. This way when you log in to the page you wont see an empty search querey.
I also implemented javascript to have two different search pages, the user can interactivly change through the two pages with
a click of a button. 

CSS: For CSS I used different fonts to make the page look nicer. I added paddings, backgrounds, border, and other thinks to
make the webpage as astehticly pleasing as possible. I also used CSS to have the cool 360 effect on the search results when
your mouse if hovered over it.
